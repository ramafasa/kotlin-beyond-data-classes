        To wrap-up:
        - We have seen how to refactor anemic, not expressive code into a more expressive, 
          domain-driven model using Kotlin features like:
            - Value class
            - Range operator
            - Result class
            - Sealed class
            - Default arguments
            - Extension functions
            - Operation overloading
            - DSL for tests
          
          
          Questions?
          
          
          Thank you!
