    What is this presentation about?
    ================================
    
    * Kotlin is a great choice for implementing backend services with rich domain models for 
      complex business logic.
    
    * Kotlin allows to build domain code which is:
        - Highly readable and concise (because we mainly read the code)
        - Aligned with business language
        - Less error prone
        - Easy to test
        - Resilient to requirements changes
        - More fun to write :)
    
    * Live refactoring to transform the anemic code into more readable, idiomatic and efficient 
      Kotlin code using its features.
