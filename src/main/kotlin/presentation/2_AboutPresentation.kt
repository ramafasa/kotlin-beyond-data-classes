    What this presentation is about?
    ================================
    
    * Improving domain model code to become:
        - More readable (because we mainly read the code)
        - Less error prone
        - Easier to test
        - Resilient to requirements changes
        - More fun to write :)
    
    * Live refactoring to transform the anemic code into more readable, idiomatic and efficient 
      Kotlin code using its features:
        - Value class
        - Range operator
        - Result class
        - Sealed class
        - Companion object
        - Default arguments
        - Extension functions
        - Operation overloading
        - Bonus: DSL for tests
